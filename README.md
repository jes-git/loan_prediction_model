## Project Overview

Loan approval prediction is a classic classification problem in the financial domain. Using historical loan data, the model learns to classify applications into approved or rejected categories. This helps lenders reduce manual effort and make data-driven decisions.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Loan Prediction Dataset** from Kaggle, containing features such as:

- Applicant Income  
- Co-applicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Amount Term  
- Credit History  
- Property Area  
- Gender, Marital Status, Education, etc.

The target variable is whether the loan was approved (Yes/No).
